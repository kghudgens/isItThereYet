# isItThereYet

I lived in Japan for seven years before I returned to the United States as a Software Engineer. And now that I have some experience in the field, I want to return to the country as an Software Engineer Expat.

I found myself constantly checking companies that would likely post postions overseas and it was always a waste of time. The constant checking daily wasnt turning up any success. So I am creating the Is It There Yet project to scrape the results of these companies and email me a list of the results twice a day, so I no longer have to go searching myself.
